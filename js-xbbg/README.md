# @xbbg/core

Independent Node.js bindings for Bloomberg-connected environments, backed by the Rust `xbbg` engine and a native N-API addon.

## Status

Supported Node.js 24+ bindings for Bloomberg-connected server environments. `@xbbg/core` ships TypeScript definitions, prebuilt native addons for supported platforms, and the same Rust request engine used by the Python package; API changes follow normal semver release notes.

## Install

Install the wrapper package with your package manager:

```bash
npm install @xbbg/core
# or
bun add @xbbg/core
```

`@xbbg/core` targets Node.js 24+ server runtimes. It is not a browser package and still requires a local Bloomberg runtime at execution time.

`@xbbg/core` uses optional dependencies to load a packaged native `napi_xbbg.node` addon for supported targets:

- `@xbbg/core-darwin-arm64` — macOS arm64
- `@xbbg/core-linux-x64` — Linux x64 (glibc 2.28+, the same floor as official Node.js binaries)
- `@xbbg/core-win32-x64` — Windows x64

If no packaged addon is available for your platform, build from source locally instead.

## Runtime prerequisites

Using the API requires Bloomberg Terminal, B-PIPE, or ZFP access and Bloomberg SDK runtime libraries available on the target system. Configure Bloomberg connectivity and credentials according to your Bloomberg deployment before making requests.

On Windows, `@xbbg/core` prepends the first detected Bloomberg runtime DLL directory before loading the native addon. Explicit `BLPAPI_LIB_DIR` / `BLPAPI_ROOT` values win; otherwise it probes local SDK roots plus standard Terminal DAPI installs including `C:\blp\DAPI` and `C:\Program Files (x86)\Bloomberg\Blp\DAPI`.

`@xbbg/core` is not affiliated with, endorsed by, sponsored by, or approved by Bloomberg Finance L.P. or its affiliates. It does not provide Bloomberg access, credentials, entitlements, data rights, or SDK licenses; users must supply and use those under their own Bloomberg agreements and policies.

## Release integrity

Release packages are published from GitHub Actions using npm trusted publishing with provenance, backed by GitHub OIDC at publish time. No npm token or local `.npmrc` credential is required in this repository.

## Local Development

```bash
# Preferred: build and copy js-xbbg/napi_xbbg.node into the package directory
npm --prefix js-xbbg run build

# Lower-level Rust build (useful while hacking on napi-xbbg itself)
cargo build -p napi-xbbg

# Stage the current platform package template with the built addon
npm --prefix js-xbbg run stage:native-package

# Run package smoke tests from js-xbbg/
npm run test:smoke
```

The JS package automatically loads a local `js-xbbg/napi_xbbg.node` addon first, then falls back to packaged optional native dependencies for supported platforms.

`bdp()` / `bds()` / `bdh()` forward `validateFields` for per-request field validation. `bdib()` and `bdtick()` forward `requestTz` / `outputTz`; `bdtick()` also exposes common include-code request flags such as `includeConditionCodes` and `includeExchangeCodes` as typed options while still accepting raw Bloomberg request kwargs.

### Date and datetime input (#317)

Every API surface that takes a date or datetime accepts a wide input set:

- `Date` (JavaScript)
- ISO 8601 `string` (`"2023-01-17"`, `"2023-01-17T10:30:00"`, `"2023-01-17T10:30:00-05:00"`)
- Bloomberg-native `string` (`"20230117"`)
- Epoch milliseconds `number`
- Duck-typed Luxon `DateTime` — anything implementing `toJSDate(): Date`

Ambiguous formats like `"01/17/2023"` are rejected with a clear `TypeError`. Naive ISO datetime strings without a tz suffix are passed through to the Rust engine so `requestTz` semantics still apply; tz-aware strings are preserved end-to-end. The helpers `formatDate` and `formatDateTime` plus the `DateLike` / `DateTimeLike` types are re-exported from `@xbbg/core` if you want to apply them yourself.

```ts
import { bdh, bdtick } from '@xbbg/core';

await bdh('AAPL US Equity', 'PX_LAST', { start: new Date('2024-01-01'), end: '20240630' });
await bdtick('AAPL US Equity', new Date('2024-12-01T09:30Z'), Date.UTC(2024, 11, 1, 16, 0));
```

Subscriptions yield scalar `Tick` objects by default. Choose `sub.arrow()` to construct Apache Arrow JS tables directly from native descriptors without Arrow IPC for supported primitive, binary/string, date/time, timestamp, and null columns. The exposed mutable buffers are JS-owned snapshots: exclusive, bounded native allocations can transfer ownership, while shared, sliced, or oversized storage is copied or canonicalized before exposure. JS mutation therefore cannot change a retained Rust Arrow source. No-IPC construction does **not** imply a universal zero-copy Rust/JS boundary. Unsupported types fail with column-level diagnostics rather than silently changing transport.
Pass `{ allFields: true }` to `stream()` / `subscribe()` / service stream helpers to expose every top-level scalar field Bloomberg sends, matching Python's `all_fields=True`. The default remains filtered mode: requested fields plus `MKTDATA_EVENT_TYPE` and `MKTDATA_EVENT_SUBTYPE`.

### Subscription lifecycle

- Choose scalar iteration (`sub.next()` / `for await`) or Arrow iteration (`sub.arrow()`) once per native subscription. The first read or draining close fixes the format; mixing formats raises `TypeError`. Reads are serialized across views, not independent consumers.
- `unsubscribe()` discards unread values. `unsubscribe(true)` returns buffered values in the selected format, including pending JS values, an in-flight batch, and the native drain; use the Arrow view's `unsubscribe(true)` after Arrow reads. Draining through the wrong view closes without draining and reports the format error.
- Close is shared across scalar/Arrow views and wakes pending reads. Concurrent closes share cleanup rather than unsubscribing twice; repeated closes do not replay drained values. Consumed and discarded pending values are released.
- `return()` and an early `for await` exit await non-draining cleanup. For manual reads, close in `finally`. `next({ signal })` accepts an `AbortSignal`; abort closes the whole subscription, not just that read, and waits for cleanup before rejecting.
- Read/conversion failures trigger cleanup. If cleanup also fails, an `AggregateError` preserves both failures instead of silently hiding the cleanup error.

### Subscription replay benchmark

`npm run bench:subscription-replay` measures offline synthetic/JSONL replay, not Bloomberg end-to-end latency. Replay batches default to **64 rows**; use `--batch-rows 1` for one-update-at-a-time comparisons. Timing scopes differ:

- `--path legacy`: row-array construction, IPC encoding, IPC decoding, and the selected consumer.
- `--path arrow-decode-only`: decoding prebuilt IPC plus the consumer; IPC encoding is outside the timed loop.
- `--path subscription-wrapper`: an autonomous bounded **synthetic** native-descriptor queue, `ArrowSubscription.next()`, descriptor-to-Arrow construction, and the consumer. It does not measure Rust descriptor production, the native ownership boundary, SDK events, or network latency.

`--consume rows|vector|schema|none` selects consumption (`rows` is the default; `rows` and `vector` touch every cell). Setup and `--warmup-iterations N` are separate from measured replay. Per-batch service timings include the selected read/conversion/consumer path; `--consumer-delay-ms` is excluded from those samples but included in elapsed throughput. The wrapper reports queue counts, drops, and high-water marks in **batches**; `--queue-capacity`, `--producer-burst`, `--cancel-after-rows`, and `--drain-on-cancel` exercise bounded queue/cancellation behavior.

Duration summaries report their sample count: **p95 requires at least 20 samples**, **p99 at least 100**, otherwise the value is `null`. These are per-batch samples, not a claim of independent live-event latency observations. Memory is sampled before/after one **separate untimed replay** using heap, external, ArrayBuffer, and RSS counters; it is not peak memory or an allocation total.

Keep the result's provenance with any comparison: input/fixture hash, Node/V8, OS/CPU, package/Arrow versions, and the resolved native artifact path/hash. When available, `.native-build-info.json` records the producing Rust compiler, build profile/optimization, target CPU/features, flags, allocator, commit, Bloomberg SDK header version and library hash, and artifact hash. Check the reported attestation/hash-match status; missing or unattested build information is not verified compiler/SDK provenance.

Live capture requires an available, authorized Bloomberg endpoint, writes ticks to JSONL, and reports existing `sub.stats` telemetry. Its elapsed time starts after connection/subscription setup and includes native waits, the JS wrapper, `toObject()`, JSON serialization, file backpressure, and cleanup—not just Bloomberg latency. Replaying a capture remains offline work. No live latency gain is established by these benchmarks.

```bash
# Synthetic 64-row batches, no Bloomberg connection needed; rows consumer is the default
npm run bench:subscription-replay -- --rows 100000 --iterations 3

# Time JS Arrow decode only, with IPC buffers precomputed outside the timed loop
npm run bench:subscription-replay -- --path arrow-decode-only --rows 100000 --iterations 3

# Time the ArrowSubscription wrapper around a synthetic bounded descriptor queue
npm run build:ts
npm run bench:subscription-replay -- --path subscription-wrapper --rows 100000 --iterations 3

# Capture real XBTUSD ticks to JSONL, printing existing sub.stats telemetry
npm run bench:subscription-replay -- --capture-live "XBTUSD Curncy" --capture-ms 10000 --out tmp/xbtusd-ticks.jsonl

# Replay captured ticks one update at a time with schema-only consumption after one warmup iteration
npm run bench:subscription-replay -- --fixture tmp/xbtusd-ticks.jsonl --batch-rows 1 --iterations 10 --warmup-iterations 1 --consume schema
```

## Usage

```typescript
import * as xbbg from '@xbbg/core';
import { bdp, ovr } from '@xbbg/core';

xbbg.configure({
  host: 'localhost',
  port: 8194,
});

// Direct B-PIPE / leased-line hosts with ordered failover
const bpipeEngine = await xbbg.connect({
  servers: [
    { host: 'bpipe-primary.example.com', port: 8194 },
    { host: 'bpipe-secondary.example.com', port: 8196 },
  ],
  auth: { method: 'userapp', appName: 'my-bpipe-app' },
  tls: {
    clientCredentials: '/secure/client.p12',
    clientCredentialsPassword: process.env.BPIPE_TLS_PASSWORD,
    trustMaterial: '/secure/trust.p7',
  },
});

// Authorized ZFP over leased lines: use Bloomberg-provisioned endpoints via zfpRemote
const zfpEngine = await xbbg.connect({
  zfpRemote: '8194',
  tls: {
    clientCredentials: '/secure/client.p12',
    clientCredentialsPassword: process.env.BPIPE_TLS_PASSWORD,
    trustMaterial: '/secure/trust.p7',
  },
});

// Python-style blp namespace
const hist = await xbbg.blp.abdh(['AAPL US Equity'], ['PX_LAST'], '2024-01-01', '2024-12-31');
const ref = await xbbg.blp.abdp(['AAPL US Equity'], ['PX_LAST', 'SECURITY_NAME']);
const bulk = await xbbg.blp.abds(['ES1 Index'], ['FUT_CHAIN_LAST_TRADE_DATES']);

// Composable override helper
await bdp(['AAPL US Equity'], ['CRNCY_ADJ_PX_LAST'], {
  overrides: ovr({ EQY_FUND_CRNCY: 'EUR' }),
});
await bdp(['AAPL US Equity', 'MSFT US Equity'], ['CRNCY_ADJ_PX_LAST'], {
  overrides: ovr({
    EQY_FUND_CRNCY: 'USD',
    'AAPL US Equity': ovr({ EQY_FUND_CRNCY: 'EUR' }),
    'MSFT US Equity': ovr({ EQY_FUND_CRNCY: 'JPY' }),
  }),
});

const bars = await xbbg.blp.abdib('AAPL US Equity', '2024-12-01', 5);
const ticks = await xbbg.blp.abdtick(
  'AAPL US Equity',
  '2024-12-01T09:30:00',
  '2024-12-01T10:00:00',
);

// Live streaming
const sub = await xbbg.blp.asubscribe(['AAPL US Equity'], ['LAST_PRICE', 'BID', 'ASK']);
for await (const tick of sub) {
  console.log(tick);
}

// Conflated market data: quote updates are conflated by Bloomberg; trades still stream as received.
const conflated = await xbbg.blp.asubscribe(
  ['ES1 Index'],
  ['BID', 'ASK', 'LAST_PRICE', 'MKTDATA_EVENT_TYPE', 'MKTDATA_EVENT_SUBTYPE'],
  { conflate: true },
);
for await (const tick of conflated) {
  console.log(tick);
}

// CDX analytics
const cdxInfo = await xbbg.ext.cdx.acdx_info('CDX IG CDSI GEN 5Y Corp');
const cdxPricing = await xbbg.ext.cdx.acdx_pricing('CDX IG CDSI GEN 5Y Corp');
const cdxRisk = await xbbg.ext.cdx.acdx_risk('CDX IG CDSI GEN 5Y Corp');
```

## Entitlement IDs

Set `returnEids: true` on `bdp`, `bds`, `bdh`, `bdib`, or `bdtick`. Bloomberg supports this option only for `ReferenceDataRequest` (including BDS), `HistoricalDataRequest`, `IntradayBarRequest`, and `IntradayTickRequest`.

```ts
import { Backend, connect, type ResultMetadata } from '@xbbg/core';

const engine = await connect({ host: 'localhost', port: 8194 });
const ticks = (await engine.bdtick('AAPL US Equity', {
  start: '2024-01-15T09:30:00',
  end: '2024-01-15T10:00:00',
  eventTypes: ['TRADE'],
  returnEids: true,
  backend: Backend.JSON,
})) as Array<Record<string, unknown>> & ResultMetadata;

const eids = Object.values(ticks.eidData ?? {}).flat();
if (eids.length > 0) {
  const report = await engine.checkEntitlements('//blp/refdata', eids);
  console.log(report);
}
```

`eidData` belongs to the outer result container, not to individual rows. The outer result also exposes the raw schema metadata through `metadata`.

## Recipes

High-level workflows that wrap common Bloomberg request patterns. Each recipe returns an Arrow `Table` by default (or a JSON/Polars result when `backend` is set) and errors are mapped to the standard `BlpError` hierarchy.

```javascript
import * as xbbg from '@xbbg/core';

const engine = await xbbg.connect({ host: 'localhost', port: 8194 });

// Fixed income
const yas = await engine.yas(['US912810TM69 Govt'], ['YAS_BOND_YLD'], {
  settleDt: '20240115',
  yieldType: 1, // 1=YTM, 2=YTC, 3=YTW, 4=YTB, 5=YTP, 6=YTN, 7=OAS, 8=YTS, 9=YTAL
  price: 99.5,
});
const bqr = await engine.bqr('US912810TM69 Govt', {
  startDatetime: '2024-06-03T14:30:00',
  endDatetime: '2024-06-03T15:00:00',
  eventTypes: ['BID', 'ASK'],
});
const preferreds = await engine.preferreds('BAC US Equity');
const corpBonds = await engine.corporateBonds('AAPL', { ccy: 'USD' });

// Futures and CDX resolution
const front = await engine.futTicker('ES1 Index', '20240301');
const active = await engine.activeFutures('CL1 Comdty', '20240301', { freq: 'M' });
const curve = await engine.futuresCurve('ES1 Index', { maxContracts: 6 });
// cdxTicker resolves the series whose first accrual date is on or before the
// date, so historical dates return the series that was on the run then; the
// resolved Vn is included by default (versionless: true gives a legacy alias).
const cdx = await engine.cdxTicker('CDX IG CDSI GEN 5Y Corp', '20240301');
// activeCdx additionally waits for the new series' first print after a roll.
const activeCdx = await engine.activeCdx('CDX IG CDSI GEN 5Y Corp', '20240301', {
  lookbackDays: 10,
});

// Historical helpers
const dvd = await engine.dividend(['AAPL US Equity'], '20230101', '20231231');
const turn = await engine.turnover(['AAPL US Equity'], '20240101', '20240131', {
  ccy: 'USD',
});
const holdings = await engine.etfHoldings('SPY US Equity');
const realizedYield = await engine.dividendYield('AAPL US Equity', '20230101', '20231231', {
  dividendTypes: ['Regular Cash'],
});
const members = await engine.indexMembers('SPX Index', { field: 'INDX_MWEIGHT', asof: '20240102' });
const surface = await engine.volSurface('SPX Index', '20240102', '20240105', {
  preset: 'MONEYNESS_30D',
  includeDerived: true,
  riskFreeRate: 0.05,
});
const resolved = await engine.resolveIsins(['US0378331005', 'INVALIDISIN000']);
const issuers = await engine.issuerIsins(['US037833FB15', 'INVALIDISIN000']);

// ETF NAV / iNAV toolkit — resolves Bloomberg's authoritative
// ETF_NAV_TICKER / ETF_INAV_TICKER relationships (no suffix guessing):
// QQQ US Equity -> QQQNV Index / QXV Index; AT1 LN Equity -> null / AT1IN Index
const navRel = await engine.etfNavRelationships(['QQQ US Equity', 'AT1 LN Equity']);

// Daily history: mapped Index targets price with PX_LAST; AT1's missing
// daily NAV falls back to the fund's FUND_NET_ASSET_VAL — see the
// nav_source_ticker / nav_source_field columns on every row
const navHist = await engine.etfNavHistory(
  ['QQQ US Equity', 'AT1 LN Equity'],
  '20260601',
  '20260701',
);

// Real-time iNAV: validates every mapping first, then subscribes to the
// resolved iNAV topics (here QXV Index) with LAST_PRICE by default
const inavSub = await engine.subscribeEtfInav('QQQ US Equity');
for await (const tick of inavSub) {
  console.log(tick.topic, tick.get('LAST_PRICE'));
  break;
}
await inavSub.unsubscribe();

// Currency-converted prices
const px = await engine.currencyConversion('700 HK Equity', 'USD', '20240101', '20240131');
```

## Engine configuration

`connect()` and `configure()` accept a structured `EngineConfig` object. The most important connection controls are:

- `host` / `port` for a local Terminal session or an already-provisioned direct endpoint
- `servers` for ordered failover across already-provisioned direct hosts
- `auth` for Bloomberg session identity auth: `user`, `app`, `userapp`, `dir`, `manual`, or `token`
- `tls` for encrypted B-PIPE/direct sessions and as a required input for ZFP
- `zfpRemote` (`'8194'` or `'8196'`) for Bloomberg-assigned ZFP endpoints in an entitled environment; do not combine it with `host`/`port`/`servers`/`socks5`
- `socks5` for proxied access to already-provisioned direct Bloomberg endpoints
- `retryPolicy`, `numStartAttempts`, and recovery settings for reconnect behavior
- `shardRequests`, `shardThreshold`, `shardChunkSize`, and `shardMaxConcurrent` for opt-in sharding of wide multi-security `bdp`/`bdh` requests
- `runtimeWorkerThreads`: shared Tokio runtime threads, default **2**, minimum **1**; this is not the total process thread count
- `subscriptionPoolSize`: pre-warmed subscription sessions, default **1**, minimum **0**
- `maxSubscriptionSessions`: concurrent subscription-session cap, default **32**, minimum **1**, and at least `subscriptionPoolSize`; native admission waits for capacity instead of allocating unbounded sessions

The JS binding forwards these fields directly to the Rust engine, so Node can configure the same auth and transport features already available in the core runtime. Invalid transport combinations such as `zfpRemote` plus direct hosts fail during configuration instead of silently connecting to `localhost:8194`.

Engine shutdown closes admission and signals idle and checked-out subscription sessions so blocked operations can terminate. Await subscription cleanup while the engine is still available.

Field-cache publication on Windows uses `FileRenameInfoEx` with POSIX rename semantics (Windows 10 1607+ and a supporting filesystem). Existing readers retain the old snapshot while new opens see the complete replacement. Unsupported filesystems report persistence errors and retain the prior snapshot, with no unsafe replacement fallback.

## Features

- Native N-API bindings (no HTTP overhead)
- No-IPC subscription Arrow construction via `apache-arrow`, with JS-owned mutable buffer snapshots
- Async/await with proper backpressure
- TypeScript-first with full type definitions
- Cross-platform prebuilt addon packaging: macOS arm64, Linux x64 (glibc 2.28+), Windows x64
