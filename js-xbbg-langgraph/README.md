# @xbbg/langgraph

LangChain/LangGraph-compatible Bloomberg tools backed by [`@xbbg/core`](../js-xbbg/README.md).

This package is a reusable tool adapter. It is not a chat app, HTTP server, MCP server, browser package, or agent framework.

## Status

Supported server-side LangChain/LangGraph adapter for Bloomberg-connected Node.js 24+ environments. `@xbbg/langgraph` is published alongside `@xbbg/core`, uses the same semver release cadence, and keeps Bloomberg connectivity in the core Node binding while exposing bounded tools, structured artifacts, and model-facing guidance for agent runtimes.

## Prerequisites

Bloomberg connectivity is still provided by `@xbbg/core`: an installed Bloomberg Terminal/Desktop API, B-PIPE, SAPI, or ZFP setup plus Bloomberg SDK runtime libraries must be available on the server running the tools.

The package targets Node.js 24+ and runs on the server side. It is not a browser package; frontends should call an application backend that owns Bloomberg connectivity.

## Install

Tool package only:

```bash
npm install @xbbg/langgraph @xbbg/core @langchain/core
```

LangGraph app:

```bash
npm install @xbbg/langgraph @xbbg/core @langchain/core @langchain/langgraph @langchain/openai
```

Current LangChain agent app:

```bash
npm install @xbbg/langgraph @xbbg/core @langchain/core langchain @langchain/openai
```

## Agent guidance

Append the exported instructions to your system prompt:

```ts
import { BLOOMBERG_TOOL_INSTRUCTIONS } from "@xbbg/langgraph";
```

The instructions tell the model to ask clarifying questions for ambiguous tickers, fields, date ranges, currencies, periodicity, overrides, or universes; request `/isin/{isin}` for ISIN identifiers and `/cusip/{cusip}` for CUSIPs; use `xbbg_bflds` for unknown fields; prefer finite recipe tools for BEQS/YAS/universe workflows; use bounded snapshot tools instead of open subscriptions; keep requests bounded; and report empty, truncated, or errored responses directly.

## LangChain `createAgent` example

```ts
import { createAgent } from "langchain";
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
import { createAllBloombergTools, BLOOMBERG_TOOL_INSTRUCTIONS } from "@xbbg/langgraph";

const tools = createAllBloombergTools({
  maxSecurities: 10,
  maxFields: 10,
});

const agent = createAgent({
  model: new ChatOpenAI({ model: "gpt-4.1" }),
  tools,
  systemPrompt: BLOOMBERG_TOOL_INSTRUCTIONS,
});

const result = await agent.invoke({
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Get <FIELD> for <TICKER> <MARKET_SECTOR>." }],
});
```

## LangGraph example

`createReactAgent` from `@langchain/langgraph/prebuilt` is deprecated upstream in favor of `createAgent` from `langchain`, but it is still common in LangGraph examples and accepts these tools because they are normal LangChain tools.

```ts
import { createReactAgent } from "@langchain/langgraph/prebuilt";
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
import { createBloombergTools, BLOOMBERG_TOOL_INSTRUCTIONS } from "@xbbg/langgraph";

const agent = createReactAgent({
  llm: new ChatOpenAI({ model: "gpt-4.1" }),
  tools: createBloombergTools({ maxSecurities: 5, maxFields: 5 }),
  prompt: BLOOMBERG_TOOL_INSTRUCTIONS,
});
```

For custom graphs, bind the tools to your model and route tool calls through LangGraph's `ToolNode`:

```ts
import { AIMessage } from "@langchain/core/messages";
import { END, MessagesAnnotation, START, StateGraph } from "@langchain/langgraph";
import { ToolNode } from "@langchain/langgraph/prebuilt";
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
import { createBloombergTools, BLOOMBERG_TOOL_INSTRUCTIONS } from "@xbbg/langgraph";

const tools = createBloombergTools({ maxSecurities: 5, maxFields: 5 });
const model = new ChatOpenAI({ model: "gpt-4.1" }).bindTools(tools);
const toolNode = new ToolNode(tools);

const callModel = async (state: typeof MessagesAnnotation.State) => ({
  messages: [
    await model.invoke([
      { role: "system", content: BLOOMBERG_TOOL_INSTRUCTIONS },
      ...state.messages,
    ]),
  ],
});

const route = (state: typeof MessagesAnnotation.State) => {
  const last = state.messages.at(-1);
  return last instanceof AIMessage && last.tool_calls?.length ? "tools" : END;
};

const graph = new StateGraph(MessagesAnnotation)
  .addNode("model", callModel)
  .addNode("tools", toolNode)
  .addEdge(START, "model")
  .addConditionalEdges("model", route)
  .addEdge("tools", "model")
  .compile();
```

All tools use LangChain `responseFormat: "content_and_artifact"`. In `ToolNode`, the tool message content starts with a compact summary and then includes bounded model-readable JSON; `artifact` contains the structured bounded envelope for application code.

## Tool factories

Core Bloomberg request tools:

- `xbbg_bdp` - reference/current fields for a bounded securities list and explicit fields list.
- `xbbg_bdh` - historical time series; requires explicit `start` and `end`.
- `xbbg_bds` - one Bloomberg bulk/table field.
- `xbbg_bdib` - intraday bars; requires explicit `start`, `end`, and `interval`.
- `xbbg_bdtick` - intraday ticks; requires explicit `start`, `end`, and event types when the default stream is not intended.
- `xbbg_check_entitlements` - checks a nonempty EID list against `//blp/refdata` or an explicitly supplied Bloomberg service.
- `xbbg_bql` - BQL expressions only.
- `xbbg_bsrch` - Bloomberg search/grid requests, not normal security lookup.
- `xbbg_bqr` - Bloomberg Quote Request / fixed-income dealer quotes; prefer identifiers such as `/isin/<ISIN>@<QUOTE_SOURCE> <MARKET_SECTOR>`.
- `xbbg_bflds` - field metadata/search; use first for uncertain mnemonics.
- `xbbg_beqs` - named Bloomberg BEQS equity screens.
- `xbbg_yas` - fixed-income YAS recipe fields for yield, duration, spread, benchmark, or price analytics.
- `xbbg_preferreds` - preferred stock discovery for one equity ticker.
- `xbbg_corporate_bonds` - corporate bond universe query for one issuer/company ticker.
- `xbbg_index_members` - index constituents through the core index recipe.
- `xbbg_resolve_isins` - raw ISIN-to-security resolution; pass raw ISIN strings to this recipe only.
- `xbbg_issuer_isins` - issuer/bond ISIN workflow starting from known bond ISIN strings.
- `xbbg_etf_holdings` - ETF holdings for one ETF ticker.
- `xbbg_stream_snapshot` - bounded `//blp/mktdata` live observation that always unsubscribes.
- `xbbg_mktbar_snapshot` - bounded `//blp/mktbar` live bar observation for one ticker.
- `xbbg_depth_snapshot` - bounded `//blp/mktdepthdata` market-depth observation for one ticker.

### Entitlement IDs

The `xbbg_bdp`, `xbbg_bds`, `xbbg_bdh`, `xbbg_bdib`, and `xbbg_bdtick` inputs accept `returnEids: true`. These map only to Bloomberg's EID-capable `ReferenceDataRequest` (including BDS), `HistoricalDataRequest`, `IntradayBarRequest`, and `IntradayTickRequest` operations.

When EIDs are requested, bounded tool artifacts retain result metadata alongside the bounded rows:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "rows": [],
    "eidData": { "<TICKER> <MARKET_SECTOR>": [101, 202] },
    "metadata": { "xbbg.eid_data": "{\"<TICKER> <MARKET_SECTOR>\":[101,202]}" }
  },
  "rowCount": 0,
  "truncated": false
}
```

Row bounding does not discard `eidData`, `metadata`, `securityErrors`, or `fieldExceptions`. Pass the collected IDs to `xbbg_check_entitlements`:

```json
{ "eids": [101, 202], "service": "//blp/refdata" }
```

Securities are passed through in the form the user supplied them: Bloomberg tickers as `<TICKER> <MARKET_SECTOR>` (for example `<TICKER> <EXCHANGE> Equity`, `<INDEX_TICKER> Index`, `<CCY_PAIR> Curncy`), raw ISINs as `/isin/<ISIN>`, raw CUSIPs as `/cusip/<CUSIP>`. The market sector ending is Bloomberg's yellow key — `Equity`, `Index`, `Curncy`, `Comdty`, `Corp`, `Govt`, `Muni`, `Mtge`, `M-Mkt`, or `Pfd` (preferred securities) — and request tools pass it through to Bloomberg unvalidated. The agent guidance and every securities/ticker field description instruct the model that the ticker format is a template, not authorization to construct one — identifiers are never converted into guessed tickers; `xbbg_resolve_isins` exists for explicit resolution. Note `xbbg_ext_ticker`'s `parse_ticker` is narrower than the request tools: it parses generic futures-style tickers only (`Index`/`Curncy`/`Comdty`/`Corp`, or `<ROOT><N> <EXCHANGE> Equity`) and rejects other sectors.
BQL is passed as one complete expression string. Use placeholder shapes such as `get(<FIELD>) for('<TICKER> <MARKET_SECTOR>')`, `get(<FIELD_1>, <FIELD_2>) for(['<TICKER_1> <MARKET_SECTOR>', '<TICKER_2> <MARKET_SECTOR>'])`, `get(<FIELD>, <WEIGHT_FIELD>) for(holdings('<ETF_TICKER> <MARKET_SECTOR>'))`, or `get(<FIELD>) for(members('<INDEX_TICKER> <MARKET_SECTOR>')) with(...)`. Prefer `xbbg_bdp`/`xbbg_bdh` for simple reference or historical requests.

Dealer quote / BQR workflows in xbbg use fixed-income identifiers with a quote source, for example `/isin/<ISIN>@<QUOTE_SOURCE> <MARKET_SECTOR>`; use `xbbg_bqr` for that workflow and `xbbg_bdtick` for raw intraday ticks.

Streaming surfaces are intentionally exposed only as bounded snapshot tools. Each snapshot requires `maxUpdates`, applies the configured `maxStreamUpdates`/`maxStreamWaitMs` caps, stops on count, timeout, or stream completion, and calls `unsubscribe(false)` unless `drain: true` is explicitly provided. The package does not expose open-ended async subscription iterators as agent tools. If collection succeeds but releasing the subscription fails, the snapshot result still returns the collected updates and reports the failure in an `unsubscribeError` field instead of discarding data.

```ts
import { createBloombergTools, createBdpTool } from "@xbbg/langgraph";

const tools = createBloombergTools();
const bdpOnly = createBdpTool({ maxSecurities: 3 });
```

Extension helper tools:

- `xbbg_ext_ticker` - ticker hygiene before live requests: parse, normalize lists, filter equity tickers, check specific contracts, and validate generic futures tickers.
- `xbbg_ext_futures` - futures construction and selection: month-code lookup, build a specific contract, generate candidates from a generic, rank contracts, filter by cycle, and filter valid contracts for a date.
- `xbbg_ext_cdx` - CDX workflows: parse CDX tickers, roll to previous series, resolve generic to specific series, and run predefined CDX info/pricing/risk field bundles.
- `xbbg_ext_currency` - currency planning: build FX pair metadata, test same-currency requests, and identify currencies needing conversion to a target.
- `xbbg_ext_bql_builder` - BQL query builders for preferred stocks, corporate bonds, and ETF holdings; prefer these over hand-writing those query shapes.
- `xbbg_ext_market_session` - exchange sessions and timezones: derive sessions, infer timezone, convert local session times to UTC, fetch market rules, compute turnover/BQR default ranges, and inspect exchange overrides.
- `xbbg_ext_yas_overrides` - build flat YAS override maps for lower-level fixed-income BDP workflows. Prefer `xbbg_yas` when you want the actual YAS recipe result.
- `xbbg_ext_constants` - static constants and formatting helpers for dates, futures months, dividend types, and ETF/dividend columns.
- `xbbg_ext_columns` - rename helpers for dividend, ETF, and earnings-shaped Bloomberg responses.
- `xbbg_ext_calculate` - small numeric helper for level percentage calculations.
- `xbbg_ext_chart_spec` - renderer-neutral chart specs for frontend generative UI; converts bounded rows from `xbbg_bdh`, `xbbg_bdib`, holdings, depth, or already-shaped row data into Vega-Lite JSON.

```ts
import { createBloombergExtTools, createAllBloombergTools } from "@xbbg/langgraph";

const helperTools = createBloombergExtTools();
const allTools = createAllBloombergTools({
  disabledTools: ["xbbg_bql", "xbbg_bsrch"],
});
```

### Chart specs and generative UI frontends

`xbbg_ext_chart_spec` does not fetch Bloomberg data and does not render images. Use a data tool first, then pass its bounded rows into the chart-spec helper. The result is a portable visualization payload:

```json
{
  "kind": "xbbg.visualization",
  "component": "xbbg_chart",
  "renderer": "vega-lite",
  "spec": { "data": { "values": [] }, "mark": { "type": "line" } }
}
```

Frontend runtimes should register their own `xbbg_chart` component and render `data.spec` with their preferred Vega-Lite React wrapper. This keeps `@xbbg/langgraph` dependency-free and works with CopilotKit `useRenderTool`, assistant-ui data/generative UI renderers, Vercel AI SDK tool parts, or LangGraph `typedUi()` adapters.

Example tool input after a historical request:

```json
{
  "source": "bdh",
  "rows": [{ "ticker": "AAPL US Equity", "date": "20240102", "value": 190.1 }],
  "xField": "date",
  "yFields": ["value"],
  "seriesField": "ticker",
  "title": "AAPL PX_LAST"
}
```

## Engine handling

By default the first tool invocation lazily imports `@xbbg/core`, calls `connect(engineConfig)`, and reuses the resulting engine across the tool set. Parallel LangGraph tool calls share the same in-flight initialization promise.

Lazily connected engines get a hard per-request timeout (`DEFAULT_ENGINE_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS`, 60s) because `@xbbg/core` disables request timeouts by default, which would let a wedged Terminal session hang tool calls forever. Pass `engineConfig: { requestTimeoutMs: ... }` to change it, or `0` to disable. A user-supplied `engine` is used as-is — its configuration and lifecycle (including disconnect) stay with the caller.

```ts
import * as xbbg from "@xbbg/core";
import { createBloombergTools } from "@xbbg/langgraph";

const engine = await xbbg.connect({ host: "localhost", port: 8194 });
const tools = createBloombergTools({ engine });
```

### Cancellation

Tools honor the LangChain/LangGraph `AbortSignal` (`graph.invoke(input, { signal })`): an aborted call rejects immediately, already-cancelled calls never start Bloomberg work, and snapshot tools stop collecting and unsubscribe right away (skipping `drain`) instead of running out their timeout. In-flight Bloomberg request/response calls cannot be cancelled mid-flight; they are bounded by the engine request timeout above.

## Limits and outputs

Defaults:

- `maxSecurities = 25`
- `maxFields = 25`
- `maxRows = 500`
- `maxStringChars = 2000`
- `maxStreamUpdates = 10`
- `maxStreamWaitMs = 15000`

Date inputs accept `YYYY-MM-DD` or `YYYYMMDD` strings, integer `YYYYMMDD` values (parsed as calendar dates), and epoch milliseconds; ambiguous numbers between those ranges and ambiguous `MM/DD/YYYY` strings are rejected with actionable schema errors. `Date` instances are deliberately not part of the wire contract: JSON tool calls cannot carry them and `z.date()` breaks JSON Schema conversion in zod v4.

Schemas only advertise parameters the engine accepts: `format` exists on `xbbg_bdp`/`xbbg_bdh` only, because the engine rejects it for BulkData (`xbbg_bds`), BQL, search, field-info, and BEQS output; a model-sent `format` on those tools is stripped rather than forwarded. The exported `toolParameterJsonSchema(tool)` returns the provider-ready `$ref`-free JSON Schema used in each tool's embedded provider definition.

Empty results are called out in the model-facing summary (`empty result; verify identifiers, fields, and date range before concluding no data exists`) so agents distinguish "no rows" from silent failure instead of inventing data.

Each tool uses `backend: "json"` for finite request results and LangChain `content_and_artifact` output. The model-facing content starts with a short summary and then includes bounded JSON data:

```text
xbbg_bdp: 1 row; truncated=false
{"tool":"xbbg_bdp","rowCount":1,"truncated":false,"data":[{"security":"<TICKER> <MARKET_SECTOR>","field":"<FIELD>","value":"<VALUE>"}]}
```

The artifact is the same bounded structured envelope for application code:

```json
{
  "tool": "xbbg_bdp",
  "rowCount": 1,
  "truncated": false,
  "data": [{ "security": "<TICKER> <MARKET_SECTOR>", "field": "<FIELD>", "value": "<VALUE>" }]
}
```

When invoking tools outside an agent graph and you need the artifact, invoke with a tool-call id (or use LangGraph `ToolNode`) so LangChain returns a `ToolMessage` with `artifact`.

Use smaller factories or `disabledTools` when broad BQL/search helpers are not appropriate for a deployment.
